## Pricing Philosophy

### Value-Based, Not Cost-Based

We don't price based on what it costs us to serve. We price based on the value we deliver.

```
WRONG: "It costs us $5/month to serve this customer, so charge $15"

RIGHT: "This business will retain 20% more customers, worth $X,000/year. 
       $79/month is a no-brainer."
```

### The 10x Rule

Every tier should deliver **at least 10x its cost** in value to the business.

| Tier | Price | Target Value Delivered |
|------|-------|------------------------|
| Free | $0 | Taste of value, builds habit |
| Starter | $29/mo | $290+/mo in retention value |
| Pro | $79/mo | $790+/mo in retention value |
| Enterprise | Custom | Negotiated based on scale |

### Price Anchoring

Position against what they're already spending:

> "You spend $500/month on ads to acquire new customers. For $79/month, keep the ones you have."

> "One retained customer per month pays for a year of RewardsPirate."

## The Tiers

### Free: The Gateway

**Price:** $0

**Purpose:** Acquisition, not charity.

```
FREE TIER STRATEGY

Goal: Get businesses hooked on seeing customer engagement
      ↓
They hit limits naturally
      ↓
Upgrade feels like unlocking, not paying
      ↓
"I need more rewards" not "I guess I'll pay"
```

**What's included:**
- 1 location
- 500 customers
- 3 active rewards
- Basic points & check-in
- Basic analytics

**What's limited (creates upgrade pressure):**
- Can't add more locations
- Can't create more rewards
- No push notifications
- No advanced rules
- No milestone rewards

**The psychology:**
- Generous enough to see real value
- Limited enough to hit walls naturally
- Limits are VISIBLE ("3/3 rewards used")
- Upgrade prompts are helpful, not annoying

---

### Starter: The Commitment

**Price:** $29/month ($290/year if annual = 2 months free)

**Target business:** Single location, getting serious about loyalty

**Why $29:**
- Below the "needs approval" threshold for most SMBs
- Owner can expense without thinking
- Less than a nice dinner
- Competes with "free" alternatives that suck

**What unlocks:**
- 3 locations
- 2,000 customers
- 10 active rewards
- Push notifications
- Time-bound promotions
- Basic customer journeys
- Advanced earning rules

**Upgrade triggers to Pro:**
- Hitting 10 rewards limit
- Wanting milestone rewards
- Needing AI assistance
- Multiple locations growing

---

### Pro: The Sweet Spot

**Price:** $79/month ($790/year if annual)

**Target business:** Serious about loyalty, multiple locations or high volume

**Why $79:**
- Still impulse-able for established businesses
- 3x Starter, but WAY more than 3x value
- Positions us as "professional tool" not "cheap app"
- Room for add-ons on top

**What unlocks:**
- 10 locations
- 10,000 customers
- **Unlimited rewards**
- **Milestone rewards** (key differentiator)
- **Point multipliers**
- AI marketing assistant
- Advanced analytics
- Campaign management
- Unlimited customer journeys

**This is where most successful businesses land.**

**Upgrade triggers to Enterprise:**
- 10+ locations
- 10,000+ customers
- Need API access
- Need white-label
- Need SSO

---

### Enterprise: The Partnership

**Price:** Custom (starting ~$299/month)

**Target business:** Franchises, chains, high-volume operations

**Why custom:**
- Needs vary wildly
- Volume discounts make sense
- Often need custom integration work
- Relationship-based sales

**What unlocks:**
- Unlimited everything
- API access
- White-label apps
- SSO integration
- Dedicated support
- Custom integrations
- SLA guarantees

**Sales process:**
- Demo call required
- Needs assessment
- Custom proposal
- Annual contracts typical

---

## Add-On Strategy

### Philosophy: Modular Value

Add-ons let businesses pay for exactly what they need without forcing tier upgrades.

```
SCENARIO: Starter business wants AI but not other Pro features

WITHOUT ADD-ONS:
"Upgrade to Pro for $79/month" → $50/month more for one feature → feels bad

WITH ADD-ONS:
"Add AI Pack for $29/month" → $29/month for what they want → feels fair
```

### Current Add-Ons

| Add-On | Price | What It Unlocks | Target |
|--------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| **AI Pack** | $29/mo | AI assistant, insights, copywriting | Businesses wanting help with marketing |
| **SMS Pack** | $19/mo | SMS marketing, 5,000 msgs/mo | Businesses with SMS-preferred customers |
| **Analytics Pack** | $19/mo | Advanced reports, exports, realtime | Data-driven owners |
| **API Access** | $49/mo | Full API, webhooks | Developers, integrations |

### Stacking Rules

- Add-ons can be added to ANY paid tier
- Add-ons stack with tier features (e.g., SMS Pack adds to existing message limits)
- Some add-ons are included in higher tiers (AI Pack included in Pro)
- Enterprise includes all add-ons

### Future Add-Ons (Roadmap)

| Add-On | Est. Price | What It Unlocks |
|--------|------------|-----------------|
| **Physical Rewards Pack** | $39/mo | Metal cards, merch integration, fulfillment |
| **Network Pack** | $49/mo | Multi-tenant features, cross-business rewards |
| **Advanced Gamification** | $29/mo | Boss battles, seasonal events, leaderboards |
| **Integrations Pack** | $29/mo | POS integrations, CRM sync |

---

## Staking Tiers (Future)

When the Doubloon Economy launches, staking creates a parallel value structure:

### Tenant Staking Tiers

| Tier | Stake | Monthly Yield | Subscription Credit | Net Cost |
|------|-------|---------------|---------------------|----------|
| **Deckhand** | $0 | $0 | $0 | Full price |
| **First Mate** | $500 | ~$2.50 | $2.50 | -$2.50 |
| **Captain** | $2,000 | ~$10 | $10 | -$10 |
| **Admiral** | $10,000 | ~$50 | $50 | -$50 |
| **Fleet Commander** | $50,000 | ~$250 | $250 | **FREE + $51 profit** |

### How It Changes Pricing Psychology

```
TRADITIONAL: "Pay $79/month forever"

WITH STAKING: "Stake $10,000 once, pay effectively $29/month forever"
              "Stake $50,000 once, GET PAID $51/month to use us"
```

**This is revolutionary:**
- Converts expense to investment
- Aligns incentives (they want us to succeed)
- Creates switching cost (stake is locked)
- Generates word-of-mouth ("I get PAID to use this")

### Staking Benefits Beyond Yield

| Tier | Fee Reduction | Governance | Other Perks |
|------|---------------|------------|-------------|
| Deckhand | 3% fee | None | — |
| First Mate | 2% fee | 1 vote | Early features |
| Captain | 1.5% fee | 3 votes | Priority support |
| Admiral | 1% fee | 10 votes | Revenue share |
| Fleet Commander | 0.5% fee | Veto power | Treasury oversight |

## Competitive Positioning

### vs. Square Loyalty

| | Square | RewardsPirate |
|-|--------|---------------|

| **Network** | None | Multi-business |

**Our pitch:** "Square's 'free' loyalty only works if you're all-in on Square. We work with everything."

### vs. Toast Loyalty

| | Toast | RewardsPirate |
|-|-------|---------------|
| **Price** | ~$50/month add-on | $29-79/month |

**Our pitch:** "Better features, works anywhere, similar price."

### vs. Dedicated Loyalty (Fivestars, Belly)

| | Fivestars | RewardsPirate |
|-|-----------|---------------|
| **Price** | $200-500/month | $29-79/month |
| **Hardware** | Required tablet | No hardware |

| **Network** | Fivestars network | Local pirate networks |

**Our pitch:** "Fraction of the price, no hardware, no contract, more features."

**We're the only option that's high-feature AND can be effectively free (via staking).**

---

## Free Tier Strategy

### Why Free Matters

```
FREE USERS ARE NOT FREELOADERS

Free user today → Paid user tomorrow
Free user today → Referral source
Free user today → Future enterprise buyer
Free user today → Network participant (valuable even if free)
```

### Free Tier Goals

1. **Demonstrate value** before asking for money
2. **Build habit** of using the product
3. **Create natural upgrade moments** (not artificial walls)
4. **Generate network effects** (more businesses = more valuable)
5. **Word of mouth** (free users talk)

### Free Tier Limits Philosophy

Limits should feel like **unlocking more**, not **paying to remove annoyances**.

| Good Limit | Bad Limit |
|------------|-----------|
| "3 rewards" (want more = upgrade) | "Watermark on everything" (annoying) |
| "500 customers" (growing = upgrade) | "Ads in the app" (degrades experience) |
| "1 location" (expanding = upgrade) | "Features randomly disabled" (confusing) |

### Conversion Funnel

```
FREE SIGNUP
    ↓
Uses basic features, sees engagement
    ↓
Hits a natural limit (rewards, customers, locations)
    ↓
Sees upgrade prompt with clear value
    ↓
"Unlock unlimited rewards for $29/month"
    ↓
STARTER
    ↓
Sees Pro features they want (AI, milestones)
    ↓
PRO
    ↓
Scales to enterprise needs
    ↓
ENTERPRISE
```

## Upgrade Triggers

### Automated Upgrade Prompts

| Trigger | Message | Offer |
|---------|---------|-------|
| 80% of reward limit | "Running low on reward slots" | Upgrade to unlock more |
| 90% of customer limit | "Almost at customer capacity" | Upgrade before you hit the wall |
| Tries Pro feature | "Milestone rewards are a Pro feature" | Upgrade or start trial |
| High engagement, low tier | "Your customers love this! Unlock more" | Personalized upgrade pitch |
| Multiple locations mentioned | "Managing multiple locations?" | Show multi-location benefits |

### Human-Touch Upgrade Moments

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Free user with high engagement | Personal email: "Looks like your program is taking off!" |
| Starter hitting limits repeatedly | Check-in call: "How can we help you grow?" |
| Pro user with enterprise signals | Sales outreach: "Let's talk about scaling" |

### What NOT to Do

❌ Nag constantly about upgrading
❌ Make free tier feel broken
❌ Hide features then surprise with paywall
❌ Pressure tactics ("Upgrade NOW or lose data!")
❌ Make downgrading feel punishing

---

## Annual vs. Monthly

### Annual Discount

| Tier | Monthly | Annual | Savings |
|------|---------|--------|---------|
| Starter | $29/mo | $290/yr ($24.17/mo) | 2 months free |
| Pro | $79/mo | $790/yr ($65.83/mo) | 2 months free |

### Why Offer Annual

- **Cash flow:** Money upfront
- **Commitment:** Lower churn
- **Planning:** Predictable revenue

### Why Not Push Annual Too Hard

- **Barrier:** Higher upfront cost
- **Trust:** New users haven't proven value yet
- **Flexibility:** Monthly lets them test

**Strategy:** Offer annual after 3+ months of happy monthly usage.

---

## Pricing Experiments (Future)

### To Test

1. **Price points:** Is $79 optimal or would $69 or $99 convert better?
2. **Annual discount:** Is 2 months free optimal?
3. **Add-on bundles:** "Marketing Pack" (AI + SMS) at discount?
4. **Vertical pricing:** Different prices for restaurants vs. retail?
5. **Usage-based:** Charge per customer instead of flat?

### How to Test

- A/B test new signups
- Grandfather existing customers
- Measure conversion AND retention
- Watch for support load changes

---

## Revenue Projections

### Per-Customer Math

| Metric | Conservative | Target | Optimistic |
|--------|--------------|--------|------------|
| Free → Starter conversion | 5% | 10% | 15% |
| Starter → Pro conversion | 20% | 30% | 40% |
| Average revenue/customer | $35/mo | $50/mo | $65/mo |
| Annual churn | 30% | 20% | 10% |
| LTV | $840 | $2,000 | $5,200 |

### Growth Scenarios

**Year 1 (Launch):**
- 100 free users

- 1,000 free users
- 150 Starter ($4,350/mo)
- 50 Pro ($3,950/mo)
- 5 Enterprise (~$1,500/mo)
- **MRR: ~$10,000**

- 1,000 Starter ($29,000/mo)
- 400 Pro ($31,600/mo)
- 30 Enterprise (~$9,000/mo)
- Add-ons (~$5,000/mo)
- **MRR: ~$75,000**

---

## Summary

### Pricing Principles

1. **Value-based:** Price on value delivered, not cost to serve
2. **Customer-first:** Free tier is generous, upgrades feel like unlocking
3. **Simple:** Easy to understand, easy to compare
4. **Flexible:** Add-ons let businesses customize
5. **Future-proof:** Staking tiers create new paradigm

### The Vision

> Traditional pricing: "Pay us money every month forever."
>
> RewardsPirate pricing: "Pay us, or stake and pay less, or stake enough and we pay YOU."

**That's not a loyalty platform. That's an economy.**

🏴‍☠️ **Pricing should feel like joining a crew, not signing a contract.**
