## Overview

Allow customers to refer friends and earn rewards. Phone-based flow that matches our brick-and-mortar focus.

## Key Concepts

### Phone-First Referrals
- Customer gets unique referral code or link
- "Text this to a friend" mechanic
- Friend signs up via SMS or at checkout
- Both parties earn rewards when friend makes first purchase

### Reward Types
- Points for referrer
- Points for referee (welcome bonus)
- Unlockable rewards
- Multiplier boosts

### Tracking
- Attribution via referral code
- Track conversion funnel: sent → signed up → first purchase
- Fraud prevention (same device, same household detection)

## Why It Matters

- Organic growth channel
- Lower CAC than paid acquisition
- High-intent customers (personal recommendation)
- Competitors like Lootly charge $99+/mo for this

## Open Questions

- What tier does this belong to?
- Should there be limits on referrals per customer?
- How to handle referral code sharing on social media vs direct text?
