# $DOUBLOON Tokenomics: The Pirate Economy

> **Status:** 💡 Concept (Explore)
> **Priority:** High - Core Differentiator & Revenue Model
> **Complexity:** Very High (regulatory, technical, business model)
> **Vision:** A local commerce currency that transcends the network

---

## THE BIG PICTURE

### What We're Building

Not just a loyalty program. **A local commerce economy.**

```
Traditional Loyalty          RewardsPirate Economy
─────────────────────        ─────────────────────────
Points → Rewards             Doubloons → Currency
Single business              Entire network + beyond
No real value                Backed by real assets
Can't transfer               Can spend anywhere crypto accepted
No ownership                 Governance & staking
Business controls            Community governs
```

### The Vision

> "Doubloons aren't points. They're money."

- Earn at any network business
- Spend at any network business
- Spend ANYWHERE crypto is accepted
- Stake for yield and governance
- Trade, transfer, hold
- Real value, real utility

---

## TOKEN STRUCTURE

### $DOUBLOON Token

**What it is:** A utility token representing value in the RewardsPirate ecosystem.

**Backing:**
- Treasury reserves (USDC, yield-bearing stablecoins)
- Network subscription revenue
- Transaction fees
- Staking deposits

**Properties:**
- Fungible (1 doubloon = 1 doubloon everywhere)
- Transferable (between users, businesses)
- Redeemable (for goods, services, or crypto/fiat)
- Stakeable (for yield + governance)

---

## PARTICIPANT TYPES

### 1. Customers (Pirates)

**How they earn:**
- Check-ins and purchases at network businesses
- Quest completion, achievements, streaks
- Referrals
- Passive yield on held doubloons
- Staking rewards (if staked)

**How they spend:**
- Redeem at any network business
- Spend anywhere crypto is accepted (via conversion)
- Transfer to other users
- Stake for more rewards
- Hold for passive growth

**Governance:** 
- Vote on network decisions (if staked)
- Propose new features/businesses
- Participate in community treasury decisions

---

### 2. Tenants (Network Businesses)

**How they participate:**
- Pay monthly subscription (partially funds treasury)
- Award doubloons to customers
- Accept doubloons for redemption
- Receive fiat/crypto when doubloons redeemed

**Buy-In Options:**

| Tier | Buy-In | Benefits |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Basic Tenant** | $0 (subscription only) | Standard features, no governance |
| **Stakeholder** | $500-2,000 | Governance votes, premium features, reduced fees |
| **Founding Partner** | $5,000-10,000 | Major governance, revenue share, network decisions |
| **Network Governor** | $25,000+ | Board-level governance, treasury oversight, profit share |

**Governance Rights:**
- Vote on fee structures
- Vote on new business admissions
- Vote on treasury allocation
- Propose network changes
- Participate in profit distribution

---

### 3. Non-Tenant Acceptors

**The breakthrough:** Businesses can accept doubloons WITHOUT being full tenants.

**How it works:**
```
Customer has 500 doubloons
    ↓
Wants to buy something at non-tenant store
    ↓
Store accepts "crypto" (via standard crypto payment processor)
    ↓
Customer pays in doubloons
    ↓
Doubloons convert to USDC/fiat via our rails
    ↓
Store receives dollars
    ↓
Store didn't need to know anything about RewardsPirate
```

**Why this is massive:**
- Doubloons become spendable EVERYWHERE crypto is accepted
- Network value extends beyond network businesses
- More utility = more demand for doubloons
- Non-tenants get exposure, may convert to tenants

**Integration options:**
- Direct integration (our API)
- Via crypto payment processors (BitPay, Coinbase Commerce, etc.)
- Via crypto debit cards (spend doubloons → card → anywhere)

---

## TOKEN ECONOMICS

### Supply & Distribution

**Initial Supply:** Fixed or inflationary (TBD based on model)

```

### Price Stability

**Option A: Pegged to USD**
- 1 doubloon = $0.01 (or similar fixed rate)
- Easier for customers to understand
- Requires sufficient reserves to maintain peg
- Less speculative, more utility-focused

**Option B: Floating**
- Market determines price
- Could increase in value (rewards early adopters)
- More complex, more speculative
- Regulatory implications

**Recommendation:** Start with soft peg to USD, allow floating later as ecosystem matures.

## SPENDING OUTSIDE THE NETWORK

### Option 1: Crypto Payment Rails

**How it works:**
- Partner with crypto payment processors (BitPay, Coinbase Commerce)
- Customer pays in doubloons
- Processor converts to USD
- Merchant receives dollars

**Customer experience:**
```
At any crypto-accepting store:

Cashier: "That'll be $15.00"
Customer: [Opens RewardsPirate app]
App: "Pay $15.00 with 1,500 doubloons?"
Customer: [Confirms]
App: [Generates payment QR/NFC]
Store: [Scans, receives $15 USD]
Done.
```

### Option 2: Doubloon Debit Card

**How it works:**
- Partner with card issuer (like Coinbase Card, Crypto.com)
- Customer loads doubloons to card
- Card converts to USD at point of sale
- Works anywhere Visa/Mastercard accepted

**Customer experience:**
```
Anywhere that takes cards:

Customer: [Taps Doubloon Card]
Card: [Converts doubloons → USD → payment]
Done.

They just spent loyalty points at Target.
```

### Option 3: Direct Merchant Integration

**How it works:**
- Non-tenant businesses integrate our API
- Accept doubloons directly
- We settle in USD to their bank

**Why they'd do it:**
- Access to RewardsPirate customer base
- Lower fees than credit cards (potentially)
- Marketing exposure in our app
- Pathway to becoming full tenant

---

## REVENUE MODEL EVOLUTION

### Current Model (SaaS)

```
Revenue = Subscriptions only
```

### Token Model (Hybrid)

```
Revenue = Subscriptions 
        + Transaction fees (1-3%)
        + Staking buy-ins
        + Treasury yield
        + External payment fees
        + Premium features
        + Conversion fees (doubloon ↔ fiat)
```

### Revenue Distribution

| Revenue Stream | Split |
|----------------|-------|
| Subscriptions | 70% RewardsPirate, 30% Treasury |
| Transaction fees | 50% RP, 30% Treasury, 20% Stakers |
| Staking buy-ins | 100% Treasury (backs tokens) |
| Treasury yield | 40% RP, 40% Customer yield, 20% Tenant yield |
| Conversion fees | 80% RP, 20% Treasury |

---

## MARKETING TO TENANTS

### The Pitch

> "Don't just run a loyalty program. Own a piece of the network."

**Value props:**

1. **Governance** - "Vote on how the network runs"
2. **Revenue share** - "Earn from every transaction in the network"
3. **Reduced fees** - "The more you stake, the less you pay"
4. **Customer access** - "Tap into the entire network's customer base"
5. **Yield** - "Your stake earns returns while you sleep"
6. **Exit value** - "Your stake appreciates as network grows"

### Tenant Acquisition Funnel

```
Free tier (just subscription)
    ↓
"Stake $500, reduce fees from 3% to 2%"
    ↓
"Stake $2,000, get governance + 1.5% fees"
    ↓
"Stake $10,000, get revenue share"
    ↓
They're now deeply invested in network success
```

## REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS

### Key Questions

1. **Is $DOUBLOON a security?**
   - Utility token argument: Used for goods/services
   - Howey test considerations
   - Need legal counsel

2. **Money transmitter license?**
   - If converting doubloons ↔ fiat
   - State-by-state requirements
   - May need MSB registration

3. **GENIUS Act implications**
   - Yield-bearing stablecoins restricted for US retail
   - Our structure: We hold assets, distribute "rewards"
   - May be compliant, needs legal review

4. **Tax implications**
   - Customer receiving yield = taxable?
   - Business staking = capital gains?
   - Need tax counsel

### Risk Mitigation

- Start with utility-only (no yield, no staking)
- Add features incrementally with legal review
- Consider offshore entity for token issuance
- Maintain clear separation: platform (US) vs token (TBD)
- Extensive disclosures and terms of service

---

## IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- Points system (no blockchain)
- Basic earn/redeem
- Network businesses
- Prove the model

### Phase 2: Treasury & Yield
- Corporate treasury in yield-bearing assets
- "Passive growth" for customers (not called yield)
- Business rebates on subscription
- Legal structure established

### Phase 3: Staking (Soft Launch)
- Tenant staking tiers
- Governance voting (off-chain)
- Fee reductions for stakers
- Pilot with select businesses

### Phase 4: Token Launch
- $DOUBLOON token issued (likely L2 like Base, Arbitrum)
- On-chain governance
- Staking smart contracts
- Full transparency

### Phase 5: External Spending
- Crypto payment processor integration
- Doubloon debit card
- Non-tenant acceptance
- Cross-network redemption

### Phase 6: Full DAO
- Decentralized governance
- Community treasury
- Protocol-owned liquidity
- Global expansion

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Total staked value | Track growth | Network buy-in |
| Governance participation | >30% of stakers | Community health |
| External spend volume | Track monthly | Utility expansion |
| Tenant staking rate | >40% | Business investment |
| Token velocity | Moderate | Not too speculative |
| Treasury backing ratio | >100% | Stability |

---

## THE VISION

### Year 1
- 1,000 network businesses
- Points system working
- Treasury generating yield
- Tenant staking launched

### Year 3
- 10,000 network businesses
- $DOUBLOON token live
- Full governance operational
- External spending enabled
- 100,000+ active customers

### Year 5
- 50,000+ businesses
- Doubloons accepted widely (crypto rails)
- DAO fully decentralized
- Regional networks (Downtown Pirates, Westside Pirates, etc.)
- $DOUBLOON as recognized local commerce currency

### The Dream

> "I earned doubloons at my coffee shop this morning.
> Used them to buy lunch at a restaurant.
> Then spent the rest at Target with my Doubloon card.
> 
> And the whole time, my balance was growing.
> 
> Why would I ever use regular dollars?"

## OPEN QUESTIONS

1. Token issuance: Create new or use existing infra (Base, etc.)?
2. Legal entity structure: US vs offshore?
3. Initial token distribution: Airdrop to early users?
4. Price stability: Hard peg, soft peg, or floating?
5. Tenant minimum stake: What's the right threshold?
6. Customer staking: Require minimum balance?
7. Governance: On-chain from start or migrate later?
8. External spending: Build or partner?

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. [ ] Legal consultation: Securities, MSB, tax
2. [ ] Tokenomics modeling: Supply, distribution, inflation
3. [ ] Technical architecture: Chain selection, smart contracts
4. [ ] Business model validation: Will tenants stake?
5. [ ] Customer research: Do they want this?
6. [ ] Partner outreach: Crypto payment processors
7. [ ] Pilot program design: Test with select network
